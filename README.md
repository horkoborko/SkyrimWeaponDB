Your task:  create a program that uses a SQL database API.
Due: 	    before 12/3/2021

Suggestions:

- Python
- C
- C++
- Java
- C#

No need to build complex user interface.  The program may be a command line program, or just do some task!

- *** interesting SQL queries ***
- especially constructing SQL queries

- database schema creation
- insertion and deletion of items
- update of items
- basic database stuff
- at least one multi-step transaction

That's about it.
Minimum of 1000 LOC including comments; 500 LOC as measured by cloc (non-comment LOC).  No maximum, but don't go crazy

Some requirements of the schema:

- must have at least one composite attribute
- must have at least one multivalued attribute
- must have at least one total participation constraint
- must have at least two entity types
- must have at least two relation types
- must have at least one cardinality constraint that's "interesting" (not all M:N)
- must have a foreign key
